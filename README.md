# Statistical Physics of Graphs and Networks
## Project : The Configuration Model of Random Graphs
#### Author : Mallory Dazza

-----------

We consider graphs of N vertices of given degree distribution p_1 = 1 - pi and p_4 = pi. This project will work on 5 different problems : 
* The generation of such a graph
* The emergence of the giant connected component as $\pi$ is varied
* The emergence of the 3-core as $\pi$ is varied
* A ferromagnetic Ising model
* The inverse Ising model and graph reconstruction

Each sections are dealt with seperatly with a Jupyter Notebook.

Everything can be found in the github repository : https://github.com/MalloryDazza/Project_Graphs_Network
